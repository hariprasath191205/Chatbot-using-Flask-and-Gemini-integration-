# Chatbot-using-Flask-and-Gemini-integration-
The Futuristic AI Chatbot is an intelligent conversational web assistant that allows users to interact in real-time through a sleek, modern interface. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend) and Flask (Backend), this chatbot integrates Google's Gemini API to deliver advanced, AI-generated responses, simulating human-like conversation.

The chatbot accepts natural language queries from users, forwards them to the backend, and fetches intelligent replies using the Gemini large language model. It is designed with a dark futuristic UI theme and supports smooth user interaction with dynamic message rendering.

This project demonstrates the powerful fusion of modern web development with generative AI, enabling real-time communication between users and a smart assistant.
